# MyReads Project.

This is a reading list web application for monitoring my reading plans.
It consists of three lists: currently reading, want to read and read. It allows
me to keep track of books.

Its main features are:

- List books in its corresponding category.
- Search for books to add them to any of the three categories.
- Change books from one category to another.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
* start the development server with `npm start`.
